# üåê Mini HTML, CSS & JS Projects

A growing collection of beginner-friendly projects I created to practice and master the fundamentals of frontend web development. These mini-projects were built through tutorials and challenges from platforms like [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

Each folder contains a separate project with its own HTML, CSS, and JS files‚Äîorganized for clean version control and easy progression tracking.
